anyio
=====

A GPIO Python module, that works on many platforms.

This package was written initially to support the hardware chapters in my book
Adventures in Minecraft: 

https://www.amazon.co.uk/Adventures-Minecraft-David-Whale/dp/111894691X

If you want to access the specific version that was used with that book,
please follow this link:

The anyio package aims to mimic the basic functionality of the RPi.GPIO
Python module that is used on the Raspberry Pi computer. 
'Mimic' is used in the loosest sense of the word, because all it does is 
to implement 5 functions of the same name as the RPi.GPIO module. 
This allows you to write simple GPIO programs in Python, that work on 
Raspberry Pi, PC, Mac and Linux computers.

For detailed instructions about how to use this package, please see
the instructions.md file here:

a hardware board that works with a wide range of Raspberry Pi
plug on boards:
